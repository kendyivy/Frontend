		  <h5>HOBBIES</h5>
		  <p>I love to read. Reading is my hobby. I read books belonging to all genres. But it is adventure and mystery stories that keep me the most engaged. I enjoy reading Sherlock Holmes stories by Arthur Conan Doyle. They are fascinating stories that keep me very captivated. I can read them over and over again and I enjoy them. I also love to read the Harry Potter series of books by JK Rowling.  </p>
