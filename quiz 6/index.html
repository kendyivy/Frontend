	<h4>ABOUT ROSEFLOWERS</h4>

	<div class="tas">Roses have a long and colorful history. They have been symbols of love, beauty, war, and politics. The rose is, according to fossil evidence, 35 million years old. In nature, the genus Rosa has some 150 species spread throughout the Northern Hemisphere, from Alaska to Mexico and including northern Africa. Garden cultivation of roses began some 5,000 years ago, probably in China.

			<h5>MY HOBBIES</h5>
			<p>I love to paint. It is my hobby. I paint with water colours. I like to paint beautiful landscapes. When we go on holidays to different places like hill stations, desert areas, river banks or the countryside, I always take my art material with me. I like to sit and paint a scenery as I watch it. The painting then is very vivid and comes alive. I find my hobby refreshing to me. I keep all my paintings carefully. I have participated in different art exhibitions and painting competitions at school and at state level events, and won prizes too.

			<h6> MY GOALS</h6>
			<p>I too have a goal in life. I would like to become a writer, when I grow big. I love reading books and I read a lot.

            Books have always been my companion and best friend and I have read so many different kinds of books from different writers by now.
